# W-Confirm  (VS-Code Extension)

Thought 
===================

There is a need to reduce obstacles for all individuals, irrespective of their shortcomings, to access content on the web. 

. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is developed through the W3C process in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world, with a goal of providing a single shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally.

The proposal is to create an extension for a popular IDE which reminds and gives hints to the developer during the web development. 

Over view:-
================================
 Here we tried to develop an vs-code extension that would help the developer to follow the rules by suggesting him at the time he develops the website.
   
 This extension helps the developer by suggesting the necessary attributes to a tag that would make the website wcag compliant.
  
  
  
 Working Procedure
 ===============================
  If the user runs the vscode extension alongside with his/her html code
  
 The tags  that are not following the compliance are being highlighted using the green coloue
 
 On hovering over the tags, developer gets to know the attributes he/she can use wrt that particular tag
 
 Language Used
 =================================
 Type script

 Installation process
 =============================
 clone the git repository
 run npm i in your vscode to install the nodemodules
 debug the code 
 In the new vscode code editor write your code -> ctrl+shift+p to run the extension
 It will highlight the tags that violate the wcag compliance & displays the message on hover over the particular tag.
 
 Future Implementations
============================
To make the parser effecient
To add a button so that he can disable the highlight if he doesnt want.
